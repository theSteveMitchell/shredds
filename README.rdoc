== Shredding for the wedding

Well this was supposed to be a wedding website.  It was never published because most of the art content was borrowed and I never did get permission from the creator.  I was going to hire a designer, but meh.  It's a bit too late now that the wedding has come and gone.

"As you know my name is Stephen, and I hate to do drawrings."


Has some cool POCs things in there.  Uses jquery and ScrollTo library to create a cool storybook effect.
